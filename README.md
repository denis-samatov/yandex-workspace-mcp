A production-ready Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for integrating AI agents with **Yandex Disk** and **Yandex Wiki**.

This server provides a safe, unified interface for AI assistants to search, read, and intelligently update data in Yandex Disk and Yandex Wiki, without resorting to scraping or undocumented APIs. 

## Features

- **Yandex Disk Integration**: 22 parity tools plus `disk_read` and inline `disk_upload` cover capacity, list/recent/search, metadata, signed links, uploads, mutations, public resources, Trash, and bounded local jobs.
- **Yandex Wiki Integration**: 27 typed tools plus the `wiki_get_tree` compatibility alias cover search, page reads/writes, comments, resources, recovery, attachments, and dynamic tables.
- **Unified Workspace Search**: A single `search` tool allows agents to query both Disk and Wiki simultaneously.
- **Security-First Architecture**:
  - Read-only by default.
  - Granular permissions for read, write, and delete operations.
  - Path allowlisting (`ALLOWED_ROOTS`) to strictly confine AI operations.
  - Detailed, structured audit logging of all write/destructive operations.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/denis-samatov/yandex-workspace-mcp.git

HTTP deployments have three explicit modes: loopback development, static single-tenant bearer, and multi-user Yandex OAuth backed by encrypted memory/Redis state. CLI transport overrides are validated before server construction, authenticated HTTP requests fail closed without an SDK auth context, and MCP access tokens must be distinct from Yandex credentials. See [authentication](docs/authentication.md) and [deployment](docs/deployment.md) for IAM headers, scopes, PKCE, callback registration, key rotation, TLS/proxy rules, and Compose profiles.

### Wiki tools and permission gates

`WIKI_READ` publishes eight reference reads plus `wiki_get_tree`. `WIKI_WRITE` adds page append/clone/comment operations and the grid create/update/copy/row/cell/column mutations. `WIKI_DELETE` adds page/grid/row/column deletion and page recovery. Local attachment upload additionally requires `stdio` and a non-empty `WIKI_UPLOAD_ALLOWED_DIRS`; it is never registered for remote transports.

Every locator and grid owner is resolved and checked against `WIKI_ALLOWED_ROOTS` before data is returned or changed. Grid mutations require the caller-provided revision, are serialized per grid within one process, and conflicts are surfaced without automatic replay. Page clone and grid copy accept only validated exact-origin operation URLs; those URLs are not returned to MCP clients.

Page deletion returns a random MCP recovery handle rather than Yandex's token. Handles expire after 15 minutes, are principal-bound and single-use, and the upstream token is encrypted at rest. Multi-user replicas store handles in the same Redis backend as OAuth state, so another replica can consume them after a restart; local/static deployments use process-local handles. Remote delete/recovery requires `MCP_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEYS`.

### Disk tools and permission gates

`DISK_READ` exposes `disk_info`, list/recent/search/metadata/download, `disk_list_trash`, and the bounded-text `disk_read` compatibility tool. `disk_get_public_resource` is additionally registered only when `DISK_ALLOWED_PUBLIC_KEYS` is non-empty. Every direct path is checked before the HTTP call; recent, search, embedded children, and Trash results are post-filtered before output.

`DISK_WRITE` exposes inline upload, folder/copy/move/rename, publish/unpublish, and—when `DISK_UPLOAD_URL_ALLOWED_HOSTS` is non-empty—URL import. Local-file upload and its four local job tools require `stdio` plus `DISK_UPLOAD_ALLOWED_DIRS`; they are absent remotely. Jobs are in-memory, bounded, expire, never return source paths or credentials, and are cancelled during shutdown.

`DISK_DELETE` exposes resource deletion and Trash restore. Permanent deletion of a configured root is refused. `disk_empty_trash` is absent unless the allowed roots include `/` and `DISK_ALLOW_GLOBAL_DESTRUCTIVE=true`; each invocation also requires literal `confirm=true`.

### Search contract and API drift

The canonical `search` tool queries Wiki and Disk concurrently, returns Wiki-first round-robin results, reports partial source failures, and uses a signed composite cursor. Standalone `disk_search` cursors and canonical workspace cursors are distinct and bound to the normalized query and caller. Invalid or stale cursors fail closed.

Wiki full-text search uses `POST /v1/search`. The endpoint is tracked as `YANDEX_API_DOCS_WIRE_DRIFT` because documented and observed Yandex fields can change independently. If the search endpoint is unavailable or its successful response no longer matches the typed contract, the server uses a bounded descendants fallback. Fallback results are explicitly marked `degraded=true` and `search_mode="descendants"`; authentication, permission, rate-limit, transport, validation, and normal empty-result cases never trigger fallback.

Every Wiki/Disk result is post-filtered against configured roots even when an upstream filter was sent. An enabled service with no allowed roots fails startup. Signed downloads/uploads use a separate tokenless transport: HTTPS/Yandex suffix, all DNS answers, the connected peer, redirects, and byte caps are checked without forwarding OAuth headers.

The opt-in live drift sweep mutates only explicitly supplied scratch subtrees, refuses `/`, and always attempts cleanup:

```bash
uv run python scripts/contract_sweep.py \
  --acknowledge-live \
  --wiki-scratch-root team/mcp-contract-sweep \
  --disk-scratch-root /mcp-contract-sweep
```

### OAuth Setup
1. Go to [Yandex OAuth portal](https://oauth.yandex.com/).
2. Create a new client application.
3. Grant permissions for "Yandex.Disk REST API" (`cloud_api:disk.read`, `cloud_api:disk.write`, `cloud_api:disk.info`) and "Yandex Wiki" (`wiki:read`, `wiki:write`).
4. Generate and save the OAuth token to your `.env` file.

For multi-user mode, register the exact HTTPS `MCP_OAUTH_CALLBACK_URL` instead of generating a global token, then set `YANDEX_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `YANDEX_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`, both auth modes to `multi-user`, Redis, and independent cursor/encryption key rings.
