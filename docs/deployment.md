# Deployment

## Reverse-proxy static bearer

Run the `static` Compose profile behind an HTTPS reverse proxy. Keep port 8000 bound to loopback, set the public HTTPS issuer/resource URL, and allow only the proxy-facing public Host and browser Origin. If the proxy changes Host or scheme, add only its private network to `MCP_TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS`; forwarded headers from other peers are ignored.

```bash
docker compose --profile static up --build mcp-static
```

The unauthenticated `/healthz` response contains only `{"status":"ok"}`. `/mcp` remains bearer protected. Request bodies are capped by `MCP_MAX_REQUEST_BODY_BYTES`.

## Multi-user

Use the `multi-user` profile, durable Redis, two independent key rings, and a Yandex OAuth callback exactly matching the public callback URL. Install/run the package with `.[multi-user]` when not using the provided image.

The provided image installs the project and its `multi-user` dependencies with `uv sync --frozen` from the checked-in `uv.lock`; CI builds and executes `doctor` inside that exact image.

```bash
docker compose --profile multi-user up --build mcp-multi-user redis
```

Back up Redis consistently with the active encryption-key ring. Rotate by prepending a new key, restart all replicas, allow records encrypted by the previous key to expire or be rewritten, and only then remove the old key. Removing a key immediately invalidates records encrypted with it.

## Operational boundaries

- Local descriptor upload and background job tools are intentionally absent over HTTP and in multi-user mode.
- Signed Yandex download/upload URLs are fetched by the server's isolated tokenless transport, not by the MCP client.
- A passing health check does not verify Yandex credentials or live API compatibility.
- Live contract tests require dedicated scratch roots and explicit secrets. They are not part of ordinary pull-request CI.
- Do not import the module singleton in tests or embedding code. Build isolated instances with `create_application(settings, dependencies)` and enter their lifespan.
