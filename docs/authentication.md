# Authentication

MCP client authentication and Yandex credentials are separate trust boundaries. An MCP bearer token is accepted only by this server; it is never sent to Yandex. A Yandex OAuth or IAM token is sent only to the official Disk/Wiki API, and is never accepted as an MCP bearer token.

## Modes

### Trusted local stdio

Set `MCP_AUTH_MODE=local`, `YANDEX_AUTH_MODE=oauth`, and `YANDEX_OAUTH_TOKEN`. This is the only mode that publishes server-local upload and background-job tools. The process and MCP client share one Yandex identity.

### Static single-tenant HTTP

Set `MCP_AUTH_MODE=static` and a random `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`, independently of `YANDEX_OAUTH_TOKEN`. `MCP_STATIC_SCOPES` can narrow the token to `workspace:read`, `workspace:write`, and/or `workspace:delete`; it can never exceed the enabled Disk/Wiki permission ceiling. For IAM, use `YANDEX_AUTH_MODE=iam`, `YANDEX_IAM_TOKEN`, and the deployment-pinned `YANDEX_IAM_ORG_ID`. IAM requests use `Bearer` and `X-Cloud-Org-Id`; OAuth uses `OAuth` plus the configured Wiki organization header.

### Multi-user HTTP

Set both auth modes to `multi-user`, configure a Yandex OAuth application, and register the exact `MCP_OAUTH_CALLBACK_URL` in Yandex. MCP dynamic clients use authorization-code + PKCE. The server performs a separate Yandex grant, derives the principal from issuer, MCP client ID, and Yandex account subject, and issues unrelated opaque MCP access/refresh tokens.

Yandex tokens are AES-GCM encrypted at rest. Store keys and lookup keys are keyed hashes, state and authorization codes are single-use, and access/refresh pairs are issued and rotated atomically by the backend. Revocation removes the pair. Recovery handles use the same encrypted Redis backend in multi-user mode, remain available across replicas, and are consumed atomically with principal-bound lookup keys. The first `MCP_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEYS` key encrypts new records; all listed keys decrypt old records, enabling staged rotation. Non-loopback multi-user mode requires Redis and the `multi-user` package extra.

Generate independent 32-byte base64url secrets for cursor signing and token encryption:

```bash
python -c "import base64,secrets; print(base64.urlsafe_b64encode(secrets.token_bytes(32)).rstrip(b'=').decode())"
```

Never reuse the MCP bearer, cursor key, encryption key, Yandex client secret, or downstream token for another purpose.

## Network binding

Loopback HTTP is allowed for development. A non-loopback listener requires an authenticated MCP mode, HTTPS issuer/resource/callback URLs, exact non-wildcard `MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS` and `MCP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, and persistent cursor keys. TLS normally terminates at a reverse proxy. Forwarded scheme/host headers are honored only when the direct peer belongs to `MCP_TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS`.
